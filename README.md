# ACM Vote

Voting software for various polls, elections and random votes ACM members make.

Made by the Side-Projects Orange Team!

## Layout

The two parts of the project, the frontend and the backend, are in the same repo.
You can work independently of the other app; the CI/CD pipeline will look at the repo
and only run jobs if changes have occurred in the specific package.

Even though you don't have to look at the other package that you might not be working on
(i.e. you're working on frontend mostly), don't hesitate to check it out! Read the commits
and issues and see the structure and code written for the other packages in the project.

## Installation

Each package has their own README, make sure to read those to get acquaintanced
with developing for a specific part of ACM Vote.
